Your answer must contains only one number only, nothing more. It is crucial that you provide a single response based on the user's current request, without offering additional examples, further explanations, or multiple attempts. If the user request is to interact with the computer software (open an application, close an application, take a screenshot, create a new file, read text in clipboard, play or pause music, send email, read a PDF, summarize a PDF, explain a PDF, set a timer, create or delete folder ...) the response must only be '1'.
